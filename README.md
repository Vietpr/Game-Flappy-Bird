# Game-Flappy-Bird
# Motivation:
While learning python language I found it quite interesting so I decided to do a project to learn more about this language and I chose Flappy Bird to do it. However, creating a game is not an easy thing. It was a challenge for me and also required perseverance, dedication and hard work in the learning process. But thanks to that, I learned a lot of new things, so I hope what I share will help you.
# Introduction:
Flappy Bird is a popular 2D side-scrolling game developed by Vietnamese game developer, Dong Nguyen. The game was originally released in 2013 and gained popularity due to its simple gameplay and challenging difficulty level.
